            There are many tourist places present in the world which have some well described 
            speciality uncommon to any other nation. But India is a bit ahead in this race as 
            it offers its tourists with much more uncommon things. Yes, that’s right. Otherwise 
            where else will you find the beauty of backwaters along with spice gardens and a 
            topping of eye-catching sunrise and sunset views.

           That’s Kerala for you, the God’s Own Country, where the south side beauty is so much 
           visible in its sights, historical museums, palaces, wild life sanctuaries and tea 
           plantations and backwaters, that ten days look too small for a mind blowing visit.
